Coding along with MayanWolfe's full stack app stream to create a very basic MVC CRUD app using dotenv, .ejs, node, express, and MongoDB (mongoose).

## To run this code on your own fork:

- Install all dependencies with `npm install`

- Create a `.env` file and add the following as `key: value` 
  - PORT: 8000 
  - DB_CONNECTION: `your database URI`
